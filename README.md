  - Clean context management (fresh context for each new PDF)

- üîç Intelligent Question Answering
  - Powered by Google's Gemini model
  - Context-aware responses
  - Real-time processing

- üéØ User-Friendly Interface
  - Simple drag-and-drop PDF upload
  - Clear success/error messages
  - Currently loaded PDF indicator
  - Easy document switching

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
